Our renewables reports provide important information about actual renewable energy within the ISO grid 
as California moves towards a 33 percent renewable generation portfolio.
The reports use raw data and are not intended to be used as the basis for operational or financial decisions.

The dataset has hourly reports on the power production from various power sources (measured in megawatts).

Daily Renewables Watch - discontinued
The data previously found in the Renewables Watch Report is now available in Todayâ€™s Outlook and ISO Today mobile app. The Renewables Watch report was discontinued as of Dec. 1, 2021

-- Preview questions
What can this dataset tell us about the production of renewable energy over time?
Which methods of energy generating are most used? 
Which of the various energy methods are growing/diminishing? Why?
Based off the data that we have here, can we predict or forecast the next few months/years of data?

performs a normality test on numerical data. Shapiro-Wilk normality test is performed. 
When the number of observations is greater than 5000, it is tested after extracting 5000 samples by random simple sampling.

datapoints:
-TIMESTAMP - The date and time (24 hours) of the recorded event.
-BIOGAS - Biogas is a mixture of gases, primarily consisting of methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, 
produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste, manure, municipal waste, plant material, sewage, 
green waste and food waste. It is a renewable energy source.

BIOMASS - Biomass is a clean, renewable energy source. Its initial energy comes from the sun, and 
plants or algae biomass can regrow in a relatively short amount of time. 
Trees, crops, and municipal solid waste are consistently available and can be managed sustainably.

GEOTHERMAL - Geothermal energy is heat within the earth. 
The word geothermal comes from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat). 
Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because heat is continuously produced inside the earth. 
People use geothermal heat for bathing, to heat buildings, and to generate electricity.

HOUR - The hour of day

SMALL HYDRO -

SOLAR - Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. 
Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, 
and the U.S. has some of the richest solar resources in the world.

SOLAR PV - Photovoltaic (PV) materials and devices convert sunlight into electrical energy. Department of Energy. 
What is photovoltaic (PV) technology and how does it work? 
PV materials and devices convert sunlight into electrical energy. 
A single PV device is known as a cell.

WIND TOTAL - Wind is used to produce electricity using the kinetic energy created by air in motion. 
This is transformed into electrical energy using wind turbines or wind energy conversion systems. 
Wind first hits a turbine's blades,
causing them to rotate and turn the turbine connected to them.
