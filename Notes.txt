performs a normality test on numerical data. Shapiro-Wilk normality test is performed. 
When the number of observations is greater than 5000, it is tested after extracting 5000 samples by random simple sampling.

-- Data Points
-Distributed datapoints
-Outliers
-amount of hours in a year, etc. (aka lots of data)
-line graphs use a generalize additive model (GAM)

findings and observations?
-What is the seasonality?
-Which methods are used most? Why?
-Which methods are growing vs. declining? Why?
-We forecast that...

-not all datapoints have full values, why?
-potential solutions for filling in the missing values?
-maybe there is a limitation to the MWhs of these technologies?

datapoints:
-TIMESTAMP - The date and time (24 hours) of the recorded event.
-BIOGAS - Biogas is a mixture of gases, primarily consisting of methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, 
produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste, manure, municipal waste, plant material, sewage, 
green waste and food waste. It is a renewable energy source.

BIOMASS - Biomass is a clean, renewable energy source. Its initial energy comes from the sun, and 
plants or algae biomass can regrow in a relatively short amount of time. 
Trees, crops, and municipal solid waste are consistently available and can be managed sustainably.

GEOTHERMAL - Geothermal energy is heat within the earth. 
The word geothermal comes from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat). 
Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because heat is continuously produced inside the earth. 
People use geothermal heat for bathing, to heat buildings, and to generate electricity.

HOUR - The hour of day

SOLAR - Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. 
Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, 
and the U.S. has some of the richest solar resources in the world.

SOLAR PV - Photovoltaic (PV) materials and devices convert sunlight into electrical energy. Department of Energy. 
What is photovoltaic (PV) technology and how does it work? 
PV materials and devices convert sunlight into electrical energy. 
A single PV device is known as a cell.

WIND TOTAL - Wind is used to produce electricity using the kinetic energy created by air in motion. 
This is transformed into electrical energy using wind turbines or wind energy conversion systems. 
Wind first hits a turbine's blades,
causing them to rotate and turn the turbine connected to them.
